# NotWallet Expands to Wearables

We’re excited to announce that development is underway for the NotWallet non-custodial wallet app on **watchOS**, **wearOS**, and **garminOS**! Soon, you’ll be able to manage your Solana stablecoins and assets directly from your wrist—securely and privately.

Wearable devices are becoming an essential part of everyday life. By bringing NotWallet to smartwatches and fitness trackers, we’re making it easier than ever to access your funds, check balances, and approve transactions—no phone required.
