# BACH Money's Regular Burn Schedule: Ensuring a Deflationary Future

One of the core pillars of BACH Money's tokenomics is its commitment to a deflationary model, designed to benefit long-term holders and ensure the sustainable growth of the ecosystem. A key mechanism supporting this vision is our **regular token burn schedule**.

---

## Why Token Burns Matter

Token burns are a transparent and verifiable way to permanently remove tokens from circulation. By reducing the total supply, each burn event increases the scarcity of the remaining tokens, aligning incentives for the community and supporting the long-term value of €BACH.

---

## The Burn Schedule

BACH Money follows a **regular, transparent burn schedule**:

- **Annual Midsummer Burn:** Every year, during the Midsummer period, a portion of €BACH tokens are burned. This event is a celebration of our community’s growth and a commitment to our deflationary promise.
- **Special Event Burns:** Additional burns may occur in response to major milestones, ecosystem achievements, or community governance proposals.

All burn events are recorded on the Solana blockchain and can be tracked by anyone in the community.

## Timeline of Burn Events

Our [Timeline](/timeline) page highlights key milestones in the BACH Money journey, including past and upcoming burn events. This transparency ensures that every community member can follow the evolution of the €BACH supply and understand the impact of each burn.

## Deflationary by Design

The regular burn schedule is just one part of BACH Money’s broader deflationary model:

- **Fixed Supply:** €BACH launched with a fixed supply of 15,000,000 tokens—no inflation, ever.
- **Community Governance:** The community can propose and vote on additional burns or changes to the schedule.
- **On-Chain Transparency:** Every burn is visible and verifiable on the Solana blockchain.
